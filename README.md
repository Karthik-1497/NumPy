# NumPy Learning File

This repository contains a file that I used to learn and practice NumPy, a powerful library for numerical computations in Python.

## File Description

- **numpy.ipynb**: This Jupyter Notebook file serves as my learning resource for NumPy. It contains examples, explanations, and exercises covering various aspects of NumPy, such as array creation, manipulation, mathematical operations, indexing, and more. The file is well-commented and organized into sections for easy understanding.

## Prerequisites

To run the code in the `numpy.ipynb` file, you need to have the following:

- Python (version 3.7 or higher)
- Jupyter Notebook (installed via Anaconda or separately)

Additionally, you will need to have the following libraries installed:

- NumPy (version 1.21.0 or higher)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the `numpy.ipynb` file directly.

2. Ensure that you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed.

3. Install the required libraries by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   pip install numpy
   ```

4. Launch Jupyter Notebook and navigate to the directory where you have the `numpy.ipynb` file.

5. Open the `numpy.ipynb` file and run the cells to see the code examples, explanations, and results.
